# Time Complexity : O(1)
# Space Complexity : O(1)
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : Yes. It was hard to understand the problem 
# especially because I didn't know the rules of sudoku. It was easy to calculate 
# duplicates in the row/col but I had trouble finding out how to find uniques in each 3x3 box.
# It took basically the entire interview session to figure out what the interviewer 
# meant and I wasn't able to get the chance to code it.. but this took like 10 minutes doing it now
